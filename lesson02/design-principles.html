            <p class="text"> Visual hierarchy has to do with degrees of priority in a web site. This technique arranges the content on the page in a way which the attenton is driven from the most important element to least important. On the amazon's site, it is possible 
                to see on the top a large frame and as long as the page goes down the frames have their sizes decreased (compare the thumbnails at the center section with the last ones on the down section.)

            <p class="text"> The Hick's Law claims that the more options the users have, the longer it will take them to reach a decision on website. The Google homepage is a great example of this principle.
                The user has only one space to fill and two choices to make. The fewer to select, the better is for navigation user's experience. The google site is simple, reach the user's demands and is 
            a powerful tool of web search.</p>

            <p class="text"> The Rule of Thirds is a technique that divides the whole screen in nine parts through two equally horizontal and two equally spaced vertical lines. The goal is create balance on the page placing the elements on the inserction points of lines.
            This strategy is useful to build well adjusted sites by using proportional disposition of the elements on the screen.        </p>
